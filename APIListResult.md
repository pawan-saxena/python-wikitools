An APIListResult object is returned by calls to [APIRequest.query](APIRequest#query.md) that don't return a JSON object in the result (an array, instead). It is a subtype of the Python list type and is identical in almost all ways. See the [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-buffer-xrange) for full documentation. APIListResult also includes a <var>response</var> member variable that includes HTTP response headers for debugging purposes.

In general, there is no reason to ever need to create an APIListResult object (they're created automatically when needed), and they can, for all intents and purposes, be treated as a list.

As of July 2010, this is rarely used, as only one API module is known to behave this way, the [OpenSearch](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Other_services) module.
